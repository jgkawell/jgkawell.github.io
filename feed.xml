I’d wanted one for a while since building my first PC workstation for my job in a research lab and got hooked on PC hardware. My work involved a lot of heavy compute so there was a practical reason as well as a fun reason. I spent a full year planning i... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Setting up ROS in Windows through WSL2</title><link href="https://jack.kawell.us/posts/ros-windows-wsl2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Setting up ROS in Windows through WSL2" /><published>2020-06-12T12:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-06-19T13:52:03-05:00</updated> <id>https://jack.kawell.us/posts/ros-windows-wsl2/</id> <content src="https://jack.kawell.us/posts/ros-windows-wsl2/" /> <author> <name>Jack Kawell</name> </author> <category term="development" /> <category term="tutorial" /> <summary> Introduction This post is a tutorial on how to set up a working ROS development environment within Windows (complete with GUI support) utilizing the new Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2). I wrote a similar post to this previously describing how to do it for WSL1 and a lot of that info carries over here.

If you’re not familiar with Linux (really Unix-based systems in general) a .bashrc file allows you to customize certain things about your user shell by adding things like aliases, functions, different ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Setting up Powerline in WSL and VS Code</title><link href="https://jack.kawell.us/posts/powerline-wsl-vs-code/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Setting up Powerline in WSL and VS Code" /><published>2019-11-04T11:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2019-11-04T11:00:00-06:00</updated> <id>https://jack.kawell.us/posts/powerline-wsl-vs-code/</id> <content src="https://jack.kawell.us/posts/powerline-wsl-vs-code/" /> <author> <name>Jack Kawell</name> </author> <category term="development" /> <category term="tutorial" /> <summary> As you can probably tell from my previous posts, I spend a lot of time developing in WSL. In addition to this, I use VS Code as my main text editor/IDE and love it. It’s such a great editor with a ton of functionality and endless extensions. While the basic WSL shell is alright, I recently found out about Powerline which basically adds a ton of visual aids and customization to your terminal. I ... </summary> </entry> </feed>
